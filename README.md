## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
We propose a smart, AI-driven mobile application that delivers personalized crop advisory services in regional languages. The app will integrate soil data, weather forecasts, and crop history to recommend optimal farming practices. It will include image-based pest detection, voice support, and market price updates. The solution is designed to be intuitive and accessible for farmers with low digital literacy.

##Technical Approach
- Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Android Studio, Firebase, OpenCV
- AI models for pest detection and crop recommendation
- Integration with weather APIs and soil databases
- Multilingual NLP for chatbot and voice interface
- User-friendly UI/UX design tailored for rural users
- Prototype includes flowcharts, mock screens, and a working demo
- 
## Feasibility and Viability
- Feasible with current mobile penetration and government support
- Challenges: data accuracy, user adoption, connectivity in remote areas
- Mitigation: offline features, community training, partnerships with local NGOs
- Scalable across regions with modular language and crop databases
## Impact and Benefits
- Social: Empowers farmers with scientific knowledge
- Economic: Reduces input costs and increases yield
- Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming and reduces chemical overuse
- Long-term: Enhances food security and rural development
